### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I had fun coding the blog-preview-card. I learned how to properly use the calc() function in CSS. I used this to make my fonts more responsive on moblie. I also got more practice using media queries.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  font-size: calc(20px + (24 - 20) * ((100vw - 320px) / (1280 - 320)));
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing CSS, I need more practice making my web pages responsive to different sizes.

### Useful resources

- [Mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me use media queries and learn more about the calc() function.
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me find out how to make fonts more responsive using the calc() function.
